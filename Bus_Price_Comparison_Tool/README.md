# :wave: Welcome to my Bus Price Comparison Tool
## 🤔 Problem
As a professional who recently landed a hybrid role requiring me to work in the office for 3 days a week in London, I faced a new challenge of finding a cost-effective and efficient way to commute from my home in Bristol.
Trains in the UK are notorious for being expensive, so I turned to buses, which are far cheaper and often offer deals and discounts at various times of the year. However, I quickly found that searching for the best bus prices and schedules from multiple providers was a tedious and time-consuming task.

## :bulb: Solution
The lack of a quick and reliable method to compare bus prices led me to develop this webapp to compare National Express, Megabus and Flixbus prices all at once.
