        As a professional who recently landed a hybrid role requiring me to work in the office for 3 days a week in London,
        I faced a new challenge of finding a cost-effective and efficient way to commute from my home in Bristol.
        \n Trains in the UK are notorious for being expensive, so I turned to buses, which are far cheaper and often offer deals
        and discounts at various times of the year. However, I quickly found that searching for the best bus prices and schedules
        from multiple providers was a tedious and time-consuming task.

        The lack of a quick and reliable method to compare bus prices led me to develop this webapp to compare 
        National Express, Megabus and Flixbus prices all at once.
